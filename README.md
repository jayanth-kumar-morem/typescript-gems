## 🚀 Getting Started

Before diving into the snippets, ensure you have the necessary tools installed:

1. **Node.js**: TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, and we'll use Node.js to run our compiled TypeScript files. [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

2. **TypeScript**: Install TypeScript globally using npm (Node.js package manager):
   ```bash
   npm install -g typescript
   ```

3. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ts-snippets.git
   cd ts-snippets
   ```

4. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## 🧐 How to Use This Repository

1. **Navigating the Snippets**: Each `.ts` file corresponds to a specific TypeScript concept. The file name gives a hint about the topic it covers.

2. **Running a Snippet**:
   - First, compile the TypeScript file:
     ```bash
     tsc <filename>.ts
     ```
   - Then, run the compiled JavaScript file:
     ```bash
     node lib/<filename>.js
     ```

3. **Learning Process**:
   - **Read the Comments**: Each snippet is accompanied by comments explaining the code. Start by reading these comments to understand the concept.
   - **Experiment**: Don't just read; experiment! Modify the code, see how TypeScript reacts, and learn from any errors or warnings.
   - **Practice**: After understanding a concept, try to recreate it without looking at the snippet. This will reinforce your learning.
